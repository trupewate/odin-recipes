            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1½ Tbsp vinegar or 2 Tbsp</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp fresh parsley</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp fresh dill</li>
            <li>sour cream, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut meat into bite-size pieces. Slice the garlic cloves. 
                Break the bay leaves into smaller pieces. Season the meat.
                 Combine everything. Refrigerate meat for at least 2 days. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel and quarter beets. Add beets and 5 cups water to 
                a saucepan,  bring to a boil. Cook 20-25 minutes, until 
                beets pierce easily with a knife. Once cooked, remove
                 them from water and setaside cool. KEEP WATER.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large pot, bring 14 cups water to a boil.     
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse seasoning off of meat. Add the meat to the boiling
                 water. Remove scum and fat that accumulates and floats 
                 to the top of the water. It’s very important to keep 
                 removing the scum frequently. Turn heat down to 
                 low/medium, cook meat about 35-40 minutes or until
                  meat is tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                While meat is cooking, peel and cube the potatoes. Add to a bowl
                and cover with cold water so they don’t turn color. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shred the cabbage. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chop the onion finely. Add to a large skillet with 2 Tbsp butter and saute 3 minutes on medium heat.
            </li>
